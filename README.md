# PrepWork

After going through the Prep materials, I was a little overwhelmed by
how much details a good website entails, and I didn't know where to start with
my own page.

I have therefore decided to use some of the templates that w3schools provided, and
cherry picked the bootstrap elements that I liked, and literally bootstrapped my whole
page using different bootstrap and Jquery elements

I started off with the NavBar, included different sections. Used the carousel for the
photoGallery

Used some Jquery i liked from one of the templates and made some small changes.
